# DevToolkit

A collection of development support tools and utilities designed to streamline and automate common development tasks.

## Folders

### Git

The Git folder contains scripts to automate Git workflow tasks:

- **initialize-local-git-create-remote.ps1**: PowerShell script that initializes a local Git repository, creates a README file, and sets up a remote GitHub repository. The script handles authentication with GitHub CLI, creates the remote repository under personal or organization accounts, and pushes initial changes.

- **initialize-local-git-create-remote.sh**: Bash script equivalent of the PowerShell version for Unix-like environments. Performs the same Git initialization and GitHub repository creation tasks.

These scripts help standardize the repository setup process and save time when starting new projects.
